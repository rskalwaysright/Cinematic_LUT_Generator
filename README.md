# Cinematic_LUT_Generator
This project is a Python-based Cinematic LUT Generator that extracts dominant color palettes from a reference image to create a 3D LUT (.cube) file. The LUT can be applied in tools like DaVinci Resolve, Premiere Pro, or Photoshop for color grading. It automates cinematic style transfer using image processing and clustering techniques.
